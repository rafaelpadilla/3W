# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in the 3W repository. This is the
single source of truth shared by every agent; tool-specific files
(`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) only point here.
Human contributors should read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[3W_TOOLKIT_CONTRIBUTING.md](3W_TOOLKIT_CONTRIBUTING.md); this file
summarizes them and does not replace them.

## Project overview

The 3W Project, maintained by Petrobras, supports Machine Learning research on
detecting and classifying undesirable events in offshore oil wells. It has two
independently versioned parts:

- **3W Dataset** (`dataset/`, version in `dataset/dataset.ini`): multivariate
  time series stored as Parquet files, one instance per file.
- **3W Toolkit** (`toolkit/ThreeWToolkit/`, version in `pyproject.toml`): the
  `ThreeWToolkit` Python package, published on PyPI.

## Repository layout

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `toolkit/ThreeWToolkit/` | Importable package ([submodules](3W_TOOLKIT_STRUCTURE.md)) |
| `toolkit/demos/` | Numbered toolkit demo notebooks (also rendered in the docs) |
| `toolkit/docs/` | Sphinx documentation (Read the Docs) |
| `tests/` | pytest suite, mirroring the toolkit submodules |
| `dataset/0` … `dataset/9` | Parquet instances; folder name is the event label |
| `dataset/dataset.ini` | Variable descriptions, event names, labels, settings |
| `dataset/demos/` | Dataset overviews (`_basic/` is the reference one) |
| `resources/` | Self-contained tutorials and course material |
| `docs/` | Academic PDFs only (theses, dissertations). No notebooks |
| `bin/` | `test`, `lint`, `nb_test`, `sync_agent_files` helper scripts |
| `.agents/skills/` | Agent skills, edited only here (see "Agent skills") |

The toolkit submodules and what each one holds are described in
[3W_TOOLKIT_STRUCTURE.md](3W_TOOLKIT_STRUCTURE.md). Alongside them,
`pipeline.py` orchestrates end-to-end training and cross-validation.

## Setup and commands

Python >= 3.10. Dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
and pinned in `uv.lock`.

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra dev        # dev environment (.venv)
uv sync --locked --all-extras       # every extra in pyproject.toml
./bin/test                          # pytest + coverage, skips `slow` tests
RUN_SLOW_TESTS=1 ./bin/test         # include tests that read the real dataset
pytest tests/preprocessing/test_normalize.py -k l2   # targeted run
CI=false ./bin/lint                 # mypy + ruff check --fix (local mode)
./bin/nb_test                       # execute BASIC demo notebooks (slow)
```

`./bin/lint` defaults to CI mode (no auto-fix). `./bin/test` and `./bin/lint`
are the checks CI runs on Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12; both must pass.

## Architecture conventions

- **Config + component pairs.** Every component has a Pydantic config
  subclassing the matching base config from `ThreeWToolkit.core`
  (`BasePreprocessingConfig`, `BaseFeatureExtractorConfig`, `ModelsConfig`,
  `BaseDatasetConfig`, ...). The config declares its component with
  `_target: type = PrivateAttr(default_factory=lambda: MyComponent)` and is
  instantiated with `MyComponentConfig(...).build()`.
- **Data contract.** Datasets yield `DatasetOutputs` (`signal: DataFrame`,
  `label: Series | None`, `metadata: dict`). Preprocessing steps and feature
  extractors implement `transform(DatasetOutputs) -> DatasetOutputs`
  (plus optional `fit(BaseDataset)`) and must **not** mutate their input:
  copy before modifying.
- **Exports.** Register new public classes in the submodule `__init__.py`
  and its `__all__`.
- **Validation** belongs in `field_validator`s on the config, with `Field(...,
  description=...)` for every parameter.

## Code style

- Ruff (line length 88), mypy with `python_version = 3.10`: use `X | None`,
  built-in generics, and type hints on all public signatures.
- Google-style docstrings in English; docstring/comment lines up to 72 chars.
- Import groups: standard library, third-party, local (relative imports
  inside the package).
- Prefer meaningful variable names; do not introduce `Any` where a concrete
  type is known.

## Testing rules

- Put tests in `tests/<submodule>/test_<module>.py`, class-based
  (`class TestX:`), using fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`, especially
  `mock_dataset_factory` for synthetic `DatasetOutputs` datasets.
- Unit tests must not depend on the real dataset: CI checks out the repo
  **without** Parquet files. Mark anything that needs them with
  `@pytest.mark.slow`.
- Cover config validation, core behavior, edge cases (NaNs, empty inputs)
  and, for transforms, that the input is left unchanged.
- Matplotlib runs with the `Agg` backend in tests; do not call `plt.show()`.

## Dataset rules

The file layout and the Parquet storage conventions (index, dtypes,
compression) are described in
[3W_DATASET_STRUCTURE.md](3W_DATASET_STRUCTURE.md). On top of those:

- Never modify, rename, move or regenerate files under `dataset/0`–`9`; they
  are licensed CC BY 4.0 and versioned separately from the code.
- Filename prefix gives the source: `WELL-` (real), `SIMULATED_`, `DRAWN_`.
- Labels: `0` is normal operation; `1`–`9` are event types (names in
  `dataset.ini`). Transient periods use `label + 100` (`TRANSIENT_OFFSET`).
- Load data through `ParquetDatasetConfig(path=..., target_class=[...],
  event_type=[...]).build()` rather than ad-hoc `pd.read_parquet` loops in
  toolkit code. The loader downloads the dataset from Figshare when missing.

## Notebooks

- Toolkit usage demos: `toolkit/demos/NN_topic.ipynb`.
- Dataset overviews: `dataset/demos/<author>/main.ipynb`.
- Tutorials: `resources/<topic>/`. Benchmarks: `benchmarks/<name>/`.
- Notebooks in `toolkit/demos/` and `dataset/demos/_basic/` must keep running
  across releases (`./bin/nb_test`). Ruff and mypy skip `*.ipynb`.

## Dependencies, versioning and contributions

- After changing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and keep
  `uv.lock` in sync.
- Versions follow SemVer and are bumped manually by maintainers; see
  [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md). Do not bump versions unless asked.
- Pull requests target the **`dev`** branch, never `main`. One focused change
  per PR, conventional commit messages (`feat(preprocessing): ...`).
- Do not add generated artifacts (`output/`, `coverage.xml`, executed
  notebook copies, downloaded dataset zips) to the repository.

## Agent skills

Reusable task guides live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

- `add-toolkit-component`: add a preprocessing step, feature extractor,
  model, metric or other toolkit component with config, tests and docs.
- `run-quality-checks`: run and fix lint, tests and notebook checks.
- `load-3w-dataset`: load, filter and inspect 3W Dataset instances.
- `add-demo-notebook`: add a demo or overview notebook in the right place.

`.agents/skills/` is the only place to edit skills. `.claude/skills/` is a
generated copy for agents that do not read `.agents/skills/`: never edit it
directly. After changing a skill, run `python bin/sync_agent_files`
(CI runs it with `--check`).
